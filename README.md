# Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are correlated. 
This correlation is a problem because independent variables should be independent. If the degree of correlation 
between variables is high enough, 
it can cause problems when you fit the model and interpret the results.
In this blog repository, Iâ€™ll highlight the problems that multicollinearity can cause, show you how to test your model for it, and highlight some ways to resolve it.
